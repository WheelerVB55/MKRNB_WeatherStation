Greetings!
The source code provided along with its dependent libraries allow for a constant, client-connection session of up to 9 days (remotely sending data).
A SIM Home Location Register reset needs to be implemented via SIM console or subroutine, which will facilitate a longer connection session.
Manual resets will be required until further testing provides solidified reasoning as to why the connection fails after 9 days.
